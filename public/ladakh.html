                <ul>
                    <li><b> Preparing the Dough:</b>
                        Mix the all-purpose flour and salt in a bowl.
        Gradually add water and knead into a smooth, pliable dough. Cover it and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>
                    <li><b>Making the Filling:</b>
                        Heat oil in a pan. Add minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté until fragrant.

                    <li><b>Assembling the Momos:</b>Divide the dough into small balls and roll each ball into a thin, round disc (about 3-4 inches in diameter).
                        Place a spoonful of the prepared filling in the center of the disc.
                        Fold and pleat the edges to seal the momos in desired shapes (half-moon, pleated circle, etc.).
